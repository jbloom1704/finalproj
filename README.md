Final Project
=========

To run the program, simply import GameMaster.py in Python shell.
This will run the game and simultaneously generate an HTML file that shows
a more graphical output of every state sequence. 


NOTE: If you are using Python3.x, store the image files directly under the 
Python 3.x directory and store all .py files as usual in site-packages.
