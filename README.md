Final Project
=========

To run the program, simply import GameMaster.py in Python shell.
This will run the game and simultaneously generate an HTML file that show 
a more graphical output of every state sequence. For this to be compatible 
you must download all image files and store in the same directory as your
other code. 


NOTE: If you are using Python3.x, store the image files directly under the 
Python 3.x directory and store all .py files as usual in site-packages.
